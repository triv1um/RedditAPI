You can use it for work (I do, every day), but it’s definitely not the primary thing you should buy it for given its price (as the virtual desktop alone is not 3500£ good).\n\nIt’s a great overall device though, but you have to understand your priorities.

For me I certainly use the AVP for productivity but I can certainly live without it, currently. A nice MacBook / programming machine is a must.

There are perhaps ways to make it easier to use your phone while on the AVP while still keeping the ecosystem at snap speeds. \n\n2. **Save work spaces.** I reckon the AVP is perfect for longterm work on spatial projects, perhaps between multiple devices. Spatial computation is futuristic, and now that we have real life holograms, the only thing in the way is having to use the headset itself. Being able to save work spaces between multiple headsets can help us push the limits of this technology, for whole teams of developers. Hopefully saving work spaces individually comes soon, for us editors and coders and such. Though I can see this having military uses, actually. Maybe microsoft has a competitor here. I can imagine Apple is getting emails already. \n\n3. **Improved hand tracking and eye tracking**. Simply said but it’s much more complicated than that. You know how many can memorize and speak sign language, very rapidly? Now imagine using the AVP this way, quickly flying through the OS with very fast hand gestures. Changing entire lists of settings, opening an entire work predesignated work space with programmed gestures, and quickly switching back to your comfort gaming setup in an instance. No more having to move and shut every window here and there, just wave your hand and it’s how you want it. For now I myself would just use it to force quit all the apps instantly, but imagine the customization. It would be cool to be able to use a controller without having to ever hold one:)\n\n4. **Apple watch tracking and quality of life features around that** Just imagine all of this, but when I pick up my wrist to look at my watch with the AVP, theres information floating around it. Heart-rate, O2 levels, everything quickly floating around the watch in the OS at a glance. Then have it vanish when I put my wrist down. Would feel futuristic and this is definitely something the casual user would love like myself. \n\n5. **Allow snap to display for windows** What I mean here is id like to have a window snapped in front of me. I hate when I walk around the house that I have to hold a window while I do it, or grab it later. This would fix that.",

I don't use Windows enough to be able to walk you through it though. I'm an iOS dev so I'm all Macs or Linux servers at home and work.  Googling \"windows 11 enable SMB2\" gave me a bunch of hits.

Warping of background around her long, frizzy hair. Weird floating slice of pizza she was eating. Lawm looks like astroturf. One photo with a chain link fence got really trippy. Funniest was one with her face in photo stand-in because it tried to convert what was a 2D drawing.\n\nThe converted photos are great for evoking emotion, especially going back and converting some older photos from years ago. But they are absolutely no comparison for something actually shot in stereo.",
